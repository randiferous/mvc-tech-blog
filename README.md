# MVC Tech Blog Challenge

The purpose of this assignment was to apply a Model-View-Controller framework in the creation of a full-stack application.  In particularly, this tested our ability to apply a new package called Handlebars, a templating engine that allows developers to dynamically generate HTML and seamlessly connect frontend and backend functionality. We also gained more experience utilizing a MySQL database along with its corresponding packages such as Sequelize, and expanded our ability to authentic users.

## Description

The Tech Blog is a full-stack, end-to-end application that enables users to create blog posts and share them with a community of other users. Authenticated users are allowed to view and comment on any blog post on the site.  Users are also allowed to update and delete blog posts they have already created.
